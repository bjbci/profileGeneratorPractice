# profileGeneratorPractice

## Why
I made this app to get experience writing and using test driven development and to practice using inquirer, nodejs and jest

## What does it solve
This app solves  the issue of providing pertinent data about and links to people on a work team

## What did I learn
What I mostly learned was that writing tests is difficult, but I also got a lot of practice with node and inquirer and writing files to a file system

## how do you use it
You run the node application from the command line using the command :node index, you are then prompted in the command line to answer free text
questions of select the default answer, when you select finish a file is written to profileGeneratorPractice/engineeringteam.html. You select this file
and open to browser to see the engineering team. You then run
the tests from the command line using the command: npm run test.
